# Qwik Todo App vs Next.js Todo App: Performance Comparison

## Overview

I've created two versions of the same Todo application:

- **Slow Next.js Todo App**: Deliberately designed to highlight hydration costs and performance issues
- **Fast Qwik Todo App**: Built with Qwik's resumability for instant interactivity

Both applications have identical functionality but dramatically different performance characteristics. Here's a comparison of the key differences:

## Performance Differences

| Feature                 | Next.js Version                           | Qwik Version                                            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Time to Interactive     | Slow (seconds) due to hydration           | Instant (0ms) due to resumability                       |
| JavaScript Payload      | Large, entire app must be hydrated        | Minimal, only what's needed for the current interaction |
| Initial Load            | HTML + full JS bundle                     | HTML + minimal JS                                       |
| Component Interactivity | Delayed until full hydration              | Immediate, even before all JS is loaded                 |
| Event Handling          | Requires full component tree hydration    | Direct, only loads handler code when needed             |
| Scaling with Complexity | O(n) - JS size grows with component count | O(1) - JS size remains constant                         |

## Technical Implementation Differences

### State Management:

- **Next.js**: Uses React's useState/useEffect with artificial delays
- **Qwik**: Uses Qwik's useSignal/useStore with fine-grained reactivity

### Component Architecture:

- **Next.js**: Client components with heavy hydration cost
- **Qwik**: Resumable components that only load JS when needed

### Styling Approach:

- **Next.js**: Material UI with heavy JS dependencies
- **Qwik**: Vanilla Extract for CSS-in-TS with zero runtime cost

### Event Handling:

- **Next.js**: Requires full component hydration before events work
- **Qwik**: Uses serialized event handlers that load on demand

## Workshop Demonstration Points

When demonstrating these applications in your workshop, highlight:

### Initial Load Experience:

- **Next.js**: Show the delay between page appearing and becoming interactive
- **Qwik**: Show how components are interactive immediately

### Network Tab Comparison:

- **Next.js**: Large JS bundles loaded upfront
- **Qwik**: Minimal initial JS, with more loaded progressively as needed

### Interaction Responsiveness:

- **Next.js**: Sluggish after initial load due to main thread blocking
- **Qwik**: Consistently responsive from the first interaction

### Performance Metrics:

- **Next.js**: High TTI (Time to Interactive) values
- **Qwik**: Zero TTI since components are instantly interactive

## Workshop Instructions

1. Start by running the Next.js app and demonstrating its performance issues
2. Then run the Qwik app and show the same functionality with instant interactivity
3. Use browser DevTools to compare:
   - Network waterfall
   - Performance timeline
   - JavaScript execution time
   - Memory usage

This comparison will clearly demonstrate why Qwik's resumability approach is superior to traditional hydration for building performant web applications, especially as they grow in complexity.
